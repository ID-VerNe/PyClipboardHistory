### Installation & Usage

1.  **Clone the repository or download the source code.**

2.  **Set up the virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Create a virtual environment
    python -m venv .venv
    
    # Activate it
    # On Windows
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    # Note: You may need to create a requirements.txt file first by running:
    # pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**

    Simply double-click the `start_app.bat` file in the project root.
